DiscoApp v1.09b — Track Caching Improvements (2025-11-09)
------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
This update improves performance and stability by persisting release tracklists in localStorage, reducing repeated Discogs API calls between sessions.

Changes:
- Added automatic saving of track titles (D.TRACK_INDEX) to localStorage after new releases are fetched.
- Restores cached track data on launch, avoiding redundant API requests.
- Greatly reduces load times and API throttling during searches.
- Introduced background debounce to write cache safely and efficiently.
- Added safety limit to cache size (~300 releases) to prevent localStorage bloat.
- Fully backward-compatible with existing data and Discogs tokens.

Files Updated:
- core.js only

Result:
Track titles now persist across sessions. After initial indexing, searches and details views load instantly without re-hitting the API.

Overview:
This release refines the Random button behaviour, cleans up duplicate controls
on the Artists view, and moves the Details header controls into a consistent
footer toolbar.

Changes:

1. Random button behaviour
   - Random now behaves the same from all views (Albums, Artists, Details).

2. Artists view toolbar
   - Removed extra Random button from the Artists page header.
   - Artists footer now has:
       Left:  Back (in stacked/mobile layout when an artist is selected)

3. Details page footer
   - Previous header bar removed.
   - New footer toolbar added:
       Left:  Back
       Right: Random
   - Random in details uses global D.openRandom().

4. Header copy and alignment
   - Albums page header:  "Library - Albums"
   - Artists page header: "Library - Artists"
   - Artists header title aligned to the left to match Albums header.

5. Albums footer layout
   - Footer toolbar now:
       Left:  ◀︎ Prev, Next ▶︎, Show X (page size)
       Right: Artists, Random

Compatibility:
- Fully ES5 compatible (no modules, no arrow functions).
