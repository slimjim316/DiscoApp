DiscoApp v1.09a — Changelog (2025-11-09)
---------------------------------------

Overview:
This release refines the Random button behaviour, cleans up duplicate controls
on the Artists view, and moves the Details header controls into a consistent
footer toolbar.

Changes:

1. Random button behaviour
   - Random now behaves the same from all views (Albums, Artists, Details).
   - Always picks a random album from the full collection (D.allItems).
   - Centralised in D.openRandom() in boot.js.

2. Artists view toolbar
   - Removed extra Random button from the Artists page header.
   - Artists footer now has:
       Left:  Back (in stacked/mobile layout when an artist is selected)
       Right: Albums, Random

3. Details page footer
   - Previous header bar removed.
   - New footer toolbar added:
       Left:  Back
       Right: Random
   - Random in details uses global D.openRandom().

4. Header copy and alignment
   - Albums page header:  "Library - Albums"
   - Artists page header: "Library - Artists"
   - Artists header title aligned to the left to match Albums header.

5. Albums footer layout
   - Footer toolbar now:
       Left:  ◀︎ Prev, Next ▶︎, Show X (page size)
       Right: Artists, Random

Compatibility:
- Fully ES5 compatible (no modules, no arrow functions).
- Works in iOS 12 Safari and modern desktop browsers.
