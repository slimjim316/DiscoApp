DiscoApp v2.01 — Surface Pro / Edge Web-App Refresh (2026-02-16)
------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
This release modernizes the UI for a full-screen Microsoft Edge web-app on a
13" Surface Pro and removes legacy iOS compatibility constraints from app
metadata and documentation.

Changes:
- Updated app build/version markers to v2.01.
- Simplified viewport metadata for modern desktop-class browsers.
- Added application metadata (`application-name`, `theme-color`) for improved
  Edge web-app integration.
- Tuned layout for larger touch-first desktop screens:
  • Larger headings, search text, info text, and control sizing.
  • Wider progress bars and roomier spacing.
  • Denser desktop grid (6 columns on wide displays).
- Updated script-load comment to remove the iOS 12 compatibility note.

Files Updated:
- index.html
- styles.css

Result:
A clearer, larger, and more touch-friendly interface optimized for Surface Pro
full-screen Edge usage.


DiscoApp v1.09c — UI and Interaction Improvements (2025-11-09)
------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
This update refines the user interface for consistency and enhances navigation
between the Details and Artists views.

Changes:
- All buttons and select controls now share a uniform height for a consistent
  visual appearance across toolbars and footers.
- Artist name on the Details page is now clickable:
  • Opens the Artists view directly, with that artist automatically selected.
  • Matches Apple Music–style navigation behaviour.
  • Non-underlined, with a subtle hover effect for clarity.
- Minor layout and alignment adjustments to maintain spacing on all devices.

Files Updated:
- styles.css
- detail.js

Result:
A more consistent and intuitive interface with improved navigation and polished
button alignment across all views (Albums, Artists, and Details).


DiscoApp v1.09b — Track Caching Improvements (2025-11-09)
------------------------------------------------------------
Overview:
This update improves performance and stability by persisting release tracklists in localStorage, reducing repeated Discogs API calls between sessions.

Changes:
- Added automatic saving of track titles (D.TRACK_INDEX) to localStorage after new releases are fetched.
- Restores cached track data on launch, avoiding redundant API requests.
- Greatly reduces load times and API throttling during searches.
- Introduced background debounce to write cache safely and efficiently.
- Added safety limit to cache size (~300 releases) to prevent localStorage bloat.
- Fully backward-compatible with existing data and Discogs tokens.

Files Updated:
- core.js only

Result:
Track titles now persist across sessions. After initial indexing, searches and details views load instantly without re-hitting the API.


DiscoApp v1.09a — Changelog (2025-11-09)
